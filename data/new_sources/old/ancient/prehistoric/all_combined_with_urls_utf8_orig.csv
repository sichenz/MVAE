Auto-Owners success can be traced back from its present management to the early leadership of Vern V. Moulton who, in 1916, organized Auto-Owners Insurance Company in Mt. Pleasant, Michigan. The infant Company had no capital and was housed in one room of a bank building.  Auto-Owners operated in Mt. Pleasant for a little less than a year. In 1917, V.V. Moulton literally picked the Company up, placed it under his arm and in his pocket (the Company consisted of one book of policyholders' names and $174.25 in assets), and moved Auto-Owners to Lansing, Michigan.  It wasn't long before the Depression began, and Auto-Owners weathered even the lowest point of that era - the bank holidays of February 1933. The Company demonstrated its corporate toughness and financial stability by paying all claims promptly, daily, and IN CASH! The firm was then writing more than $2.5 million in insurance premiums.  Auto-Owners entered the general casualty insurance field in 1940, having previously written only automobile insurance. During the next five years, the Company found it necessary to acquire three more buildings in the vicinity of its main office to accommodate its continued growth.

Our exclusive emphasis on quality began in Santiago de Cuba where on February 4, 1862, Don Facundo BacardÐ _ MassÐ _ purchased a small distillery and revolutionized rum making. After careful and systematic experimentation with a variety of ingredients, aging and blends, Don Facundo created a new, smooth, light-bodied spirit - BACARDÐ Ð rum - what the world now knows as premium light rum.    These new BACARDÐ Ð rum blends were a delight to the residents who were accustomed to the local ""ron"" that was crude and harsh. Cuba's emerging middle class welcomed the taste of smooth, light-bodied, aged and mixable rums branded with an elegant, intriguing black bat on the label.

After Dick presented his suggestions, the owner told him he was a dumb kid and had no idea what he was doing. Dick was upset and promptly quit. He went to his grandmother's house where he spent a lot of time as a kid and told her what had happened.  Dick's grandmother asked how much it would cost to build the store himself. Dick said it would cost $300. His grandmother then went to the cookie jar where she kept her life savings and gave him $300 and told him do it yourself. Dick used that money and his relentless work-ethic to open a bait-and-tackle shop in Binghamton. By 1958, he expanded his product line to include much of what you'll find at DICK'S Sporting Goods today.  Ed Stack, Dick's son, is the current CEO and Chairman of DICK'S Sporting Goods.

These models inform the company's execution of precision horizontal targeting and customized advanced completions.    In order to find and develop low-cost reserves, EOG prioritizes exploration and drilling of internally generated prospects. This strategy is intended to consistently deliver cost-effective oil and natural gas production that maximizes cash flow and earnings, allowing the company to deliver long-term shareholder value while maintaining a strong balance sheet.

The parliament is bicameral, with an upper house, the House of Lords, and a lower house, the House of Commons. The Queen is the third component of the legislature. The House of Lords includes two different types of members: the Lords Spiritual (the senior bishops of the Church of England) and the Lords Temporal (members of the Peerage) whose members are not elected by the population at large, but are appointed by the Sovereign on advice of the Prime Minister. Prior to the opening of the Supreme Court in October 2009, the House of Lords also performed a judicial role through the Law Lords. The House of Commons is a democratically elected chamber with elections to it held at least every 5 years. The two Houses meet in separate chambers in the Palace of Westminster in London.

We've seen advances in technology and communications we could not have imagined. We've seen the U.S. population grow more diverse and the globalization of almost every aspect of our lives. We've witnessed periods of economic growth and decline, and one of the worst crises we've ever faced as a company. Through all of this, we've seen the needs and interests of our customers and stakeholders change, and we've adapted right along with them.    Our progress has not been perfect. The expectations of others, and the even higher expectations we have of ourselves, have not always been met. When we've made mistakes, we've admitted them, we've learned from them, and we've kept moving forward with even more understanding and a deeper commitment to doing what's right. That sentiment is more important now than ever. We will make it through this current situation, creating a better bank and company as a result.    We first published a Vision & Values booklet in the early 1990s as Wells Fargo's predecessor, Norwest Corporation. Since then, we've grown from a small regional bank into a national company with a growing global presence. Today, many of our team members trace their heritage to legacy companies that are now part of the Wells Fargo brand. Each of these companies brought with it new geographies, new capabilities, and inspiring stories. All have found a common cause in adopting our vision and values.    We believe in our vision and values just as strongly today as we did the first time we put them on paper, and staying true to them will guide us toward continued growth and success for decades to come.

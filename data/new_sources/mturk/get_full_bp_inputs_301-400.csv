A global Fortune 500 company, Lenovo is the world's largest PC vendor and fourth largest smartphone company.   While the Lenovo brand came into existence only in 2004, the company has a much longer history. In 1984, Legend Holdings was formed with 200,000 RMB (US$25,000) in a guard house in China. The company was incorporated in Hong Kong in 1988 and would grow to be the largest PC company in China. Legend Holdings changed its name to Lenovo in 2004 and, in 2005, acquired the former Personal Computer Division of IBM, the company that invented the PC industry in 1981.  Today, Lenovo is a US$39billion personal technology company with more than 54,000 employees (including joint ventures) in more than 60 countries serving customers in more than 160 countries. Lenovo is a global company that is incorporated and headquartered in Hong Kong, with operational centers located strategically around the world , with the largest in Beijing and Morrisville, NC. These operational centers drive Lenovo's global and local business approach.  Lenovo has grown faster than the market for more than four years because our exceptionally engineered products are meant for those who do. Our customers use innovation to bring progress to the world, and we design and build our products with this in mind, taking inspiration from the drive and imagination of the people who make things happen. Our technology helps those who do, do better.     Whether a PC, smartphone, tablet, smart TV, server, workstation or storage, Lenovo makes the products that customers need for what we call the ""PC+ world."" Lenovo is creating real differentiation from the competition thanks to its vertically integrated end-to-end business model. This model is unique among major PC makers and is a significant source of competitive advantage, helping us to bring more innovation to market, more efficiently, and aggressively attack the PC+ opportunity.  And as Lenovo expands globally, we are establishing even deeper roots in each major market, investing not only in sales and distribution, but also in local domestic manufacturing, R&D and other high-value functions. This global reach with local excellence is enabling us to build a new kind of company - a ""global-local"" company - and positions us to more deeply implement our protect and attack strategy and build the foundation for long-term success.","lenovo.png","http://www.columbia.edu/~rtd2118/logos/lenovo.png"

Dr. Joseph Lawrence, the creator of LISTERINE mouthwash, wanted to name his work after a scientist who paved the way - Dr.Joseph Lister. Dr. Lister was an English doctor and surgeon. He became the first surgeon to perform an operation in a chamber sterilised with pulverised antiseptic.   The result? More patients survived than ever before. Inspired, Lawrence created a unique formulation of his own that was perfect for killing germs in tissues, like those found in your mouth.","BD","listerine","Listerine is a brand of antiseptic mouthwash product.

This is true from the moment we hand you the keys to your new Chrysler, Toyota, Jeep, Subaru and Honda or used car to 150,000 miles (or more) down the road when you might finally decide to upgrade to something with fewer quirks.    To complement our stellar collection of products, each chosen for its unique ability to match different peoples' driving styles, lifestyles, wants and needs is an expansive certified Chrysler, Toyota, Jeep, Subaru and Honda parts store, and state-of-the art car service center dedicated to keeping your car young at heart until the day you decide to retire it.    At the foundation, or should we say chassis, of Lithia Auto Stores is a desire to bring drivers in the greater Medford area an assortment of new and used cars capable of transforming everyday commutes into something a little more extraordinary. This is why we also sell new BMW, Mercedes-Benz, Acura and Audi models such as the Mercedes C-Clas, BMW m3, BMW x5, Audi A4 and Acura RDX.    And, of course, we wouldn't be complete without our savvy, in-house team of car financing specialists. More than just being good with numbers, they're good with people; which makes for a zero-stress auto financing experience. We think you'll agree, that's pretty hard to find.

OUR MISSION  Driven by our employees and preferred by our customers, Lithia is the leading automotive retailer in each of our markets.    OUR HISTORY  Walt DeBoer founded Lithia Motors in 1946 as a Chrysler-Plymouth-Dodge dealership in Ashland, Oregon. Following Walt's death in 1968, Walt's son Sid along with Dick Heimann, grew the business to include 5 stores and 19 franchises in Southern Oregon. In December 1996, this collection of dealerships was transformed into Lithia Motors, Inc., a publicly traded company (NYSE stock symbol-LAD).

We are giving customers straightforward information so that they can make confident decisions. We believe that our local communities are our lifeblood.

FPL's typical 1,000-kWh residential customer bill is approximately 30 percent lower than the latest national average and, in 2015, was the lowest in Florida among reporting utilities for the sixth year in a row. FPL's service reliability is better than 99.98 percent, and its highly fuel-efficient power plant fleet is one of the cleanest among all utilities nationwide. The company received the top ranking in the southern U.S. among large electric providers, according to the J.D. Power 2016 Electric Utility Residential Customer Satisfaction StudySM, and was recognized in 2016 as one of the most trusted U.S. electric utilities by Market Strategies International. A leading Florida employer with approximately 8,800 employees, FPL is a subsidiary of Juno Beach, Fla.-based NextEra Energy, Inc.

NextEra Energy is also the parent company of NextEra Energy Resources, LLC, which, together with its affiliated entities, is the world's largest generator of renewable energy from the wind and sun.","In 2010, FPL Group was renamed NextEra Energy, properly rebranding the company as a forward-looking enterprise that sees the future and gets there first.  With leadership positions in renewable energies such as wind and solar that represent the way electric power will be increasingly provided to future generations, the name NextEra Energy is fitting indeed.     Continued value for FPL customers In Florida, FPL provides outstanding value to its 4.7 million customers. FPL's electric service is affordable, reliable and clean. FPL's typical residential customer bill is the lowest in Florida and about 25 percent below the national average.In 2013, FPL achieved its best‰ÛÒever overall reliability performance for the second straight year.FPL generates about 70 percent of its electricity using clean-burning American-made natural gas.     An innovative smart gridFPL's smart grid investments include the installation of more than 10,000 intelligent devices on the electric grid, enhancements to centers that monitor the performance of the grid, and the installation of about 4.5 million smart meters for residential and business customers. These advanced technologies are already enabling important customer benefits, while laying the foundation for additional benefits in the future.Continued investment in wind NextEra Energy Resources (the former FPL Energy) has continued to grow its position as the largest owner and operator of wind generation facilities in North America.In 2012, this business added roughly 1,500 MW of wind generation in the United States, more than any company had ever done before.By the end of 2013, it was generating more electric power from the wind than from any other fuel source, on the strength of nearly 9,300 individual wind turbines on 1100 wind farms and 19 states and four Canadian provinces.Solar comes of age NextEra Energy is one of the largest generators of emissions-free solar power in the United States.

The multi-billion expansion program at its St. Lucie site, north of West Palm Beach, Fla., its Turkey Point facility, south of Miami, Fla., and its Point Beach site near Green Bay, Wisc., involved six separate nuclear units and yielded an increase of approximately 700 MWe in net generating capacity. That is, enough new megawatts to produce the same amount of electricity as would a medium-sized power plant, without having to build one or even expand the footprint of these existing plants. Over the operating lifetime of this added capacity, customers are expected to save billions of dollars in fossil fuel costs.In addition, FPL is also pursuing the licenses for two new nuclear units at the existing Turkey Point site. FPL projects these units would save customers approximately $64 billion in fossil fuel costs over an initial 40-year lifespan.Investing in North American electricity transmission   As new power generation facilities become operational, it's important to deliver that electricity to where it's needed. NextEra Energy Transmission is pursuing opportunities to develop, build and operate new transmission facilities.Lone Star Transmission, LLC, owns and operates approximately 300 miles of high-voltage transmission lines and associated equipment in Texas.New Hampshire Transmission, LLC, is a majority owner of the Seabrook substation in New Hampshire and is involved in regional reliability planning.NextBridge Infrastructure is the designated developer of the Ontario East-West Tie line in Canada."flowers-foods,https://www.flowersfoods.com/,"Flowers Foods (NYSE: FLO), headquartered in Thomasville, Ga., since its first bakery was opened by the Flowers family in 1919, is today one of the largest producers of packaged bakery foods in the United States.

Less than a year later, Flowers listed on the American Stock Exchange. In 1982, the company listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol FLO.In the mid-1990s, Flowers Industries transformed itself from a strong regional baker into a national baked foods company with the acquisition of Keebler Foods Company, one of the largest cookie and cracker companies in the United States, and Mrs. Smith's, the country's top-selling frozen pie brand. By 1999, Flowers Industries had become a $4.2 billion national baked foods company with three business units - Flowers Bakeries, a super-regional fresh baked foods company; Mrs. Smith's Bakeries, a national frozen baked foods company; and Keebler Foods.In March 2001, Flowers sold its investment in Keebler to the Kellogg Company and delivered $1.24 billion to its shareholders. Flowers' remaining business units - Flowers Bakeries and Mrs. Smith's Bakeries - were then spun off into a new company called Flowers Foods. In January 2002, Flowers Foods announced it would sell its Mrs. Smith's frozen dessert business to The Schwan Food Company.

The company's advanced web performance, mobile performance, cloud security and media delivery solutions are revolutionizing how businesses optimize consumer, enterprise and entertainment experiences for any device, anywhere.","Akamai‰Ûªs beginnings lie in a challenge posed by World Wide Web inventor Tim Berners-Lee at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in early 1995. The father of the web foresaw the congestion that was soon to become very familiar to Internet users, and he challenged colleagues at MIT to invent a fundamentally new and better way to deliver Internet content. What he may not have foreseen was that posing the problem in an academic setting would ultimately result in a commercial service that has revolutionized the Internet.MIT Professor of Applied Mathematics Tom Leighton, who had an office down the hall from Dr. Berners-Lee, was intrigued by the challenge. Dr. Leighton, a renowned expert on parallel algorithms and architecture was head of the Algorithms Group at MIT's Laboratory for Computer Science. Dr. Leighton recognized that a solution to web congestion could be found in applied mathematics and algorithms and he assembled a team of researchers to tackle the problem.After obtaining his undergraduate degrees in computer science and mathematics from the Technion, Danny Lewin came to MIT in the Fall of 1996 to work with Dr. Leighton. Shortly thereafter, Mr. Lewin began making rapid and important progress on a variety of techniques for improving Internet performance. Working with the team, Dr. Leighton and Mr. Lewin developed the mathematical algorithms necessary to intelligently route and replicate content over a large network of distributed servers, technology that would ultimately solve what was becoming a frustrating problem for Internet users.Building a BusinessIn 1997, Dr. Leighton and Mr. Lewin began exploring the possible commercial use of their technology. Together with Preetish Nijhawan (a student at MIT‰Ûªs Sloan school) they entered the esteemed annual MIT $50K Entrepreneurship Competition in September of that year. Over the course of the 9-month competition, the $50K team grew substantially and their business plan was selected as one of six finalists among 100 entries. The distinction signaled that Internet content delivery had serious market potential and on August 20, 1998, Dr. Leighton and Mr. Lewin incorporated Akamai, with Jonathan Seelig (a student at the Sloan school) and Randall Kaplan joining the founding team. Akamai obtained an exclusive license to certain intellectual property from MIT, and development efforts began in the fall of 1998. Most of the company‰Ûªs early employees were students who had worked on the project at MIT.In late 1998 and early 1999, experienced Internet business professionals joined the team. Most notably, Paul Sagan, who was a former President of Time Inc. New Media, a founder of Road Runner cable modem service and who helped launch NY 1 News, became chief operating officer and eventually president of Akamai (later serving as CEO from 2005 ‰ÛÒ 2013). George Conrades, former chairman and chief executive officer of BBN Corp. and senior vice president of U.S. Operations for IBM, assumed the helm as Akamai‰Ûªs first chairman and chief executive officer in April 1999.Launching Commercial ServiceThe company grew rapidly and delivered its first live traffic (a pixel buried deep in the Disney site) in February of 1999. In March, Akamai gained significant market exposure when it enabled the delivery of March Madness for ESPN and a Star Wars trailer for Entertainment Tonight, both of which experienced historic levels of user demand. Akamai launched commercial service in April 1999 and announced that one of the world's most-trafficked web properties, Yahoo!, was a charter customer."

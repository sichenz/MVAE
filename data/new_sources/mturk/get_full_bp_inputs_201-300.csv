"eog-resources",0,"http://www.eogresources.com/","EOG Resources, Inc. is one of the largest independent (non-integrated) crude oil and natural gas companies in the United States with proved reserves in the United States, Trinidad, the United Kingdom and China. EOG Resources is listed on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) and trades under the ticker symbol  _EOG.     EOG's strategy is to generate the best rates of return by controlling operating and capital costs while maximizing oil and natural gas reserve recoveries. EOG strives to maintain the lowest possible operating cost structure that is consistent with prudent and safe operations.    The company focuses on integrating technology such as 3D seismic, core analysis, and microseismic to develop proprietary petro-physical models. These models inform the company's execution of precision horizontal targeting and customized advanced completions.    In order to find and develop low-cost reserves, EOG prioritizes exploration and drilling of internally generated prospects. This strategy is intended to consistently deliver cost-effective oil and natural gas production that maximizes cash flow and earnings, allowing the company to deliver long-term shareholder value while maintaining a strong balance sheet.    As of December 31, 2016, EOG's total estimated net proved reserves were 2,147 million barrels of oil equivalent comprised of 55 percent crude oil and condensate, 19 percent natural gas liquids and 26 percent natural gas. Approximately 97 percent of these reserves were located in the United States.    According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA), fossil fuels account for about 82 percent of the total energy consumed in the U.S. This energy is used to heat our homes, generate electricity, power our industries and meet our transportation needs.    Having abundant, clean-burning sources of domestically produced energy means more affordable energy prices. This increases incentives for energy-intensive manufacturing companies to remain in the United States. It also creates more jobs and provides for a better energy future for America.    EOG Resources is committed to bolstering North American energy supplies by finding and producing crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids, while adhering to sound environmental, health and safety standards in its operations.    In the United States, according to the EIA, about 60 percent of the country's homes are heated by safe, affordable, clean-burning natural gas. This important domestic energy source is also used to produce steel, glass, paper, clothing, brick and electricity, and is an essential raw material for many common products such as fertilizer. The increased use of natural gas is also important in addressing climate change concerns because of its clean, low-carbon content.    The EIA has also reported that crude oil accounts for about 92 percent of the total energy consumed for transportation in the United States.

Leon Levine believed he could offer his customers a variety of high-quality, good value merchandise for under $2. Because he had grown up in his family's retail store, he understood value, quality and customer satisfaction.   In November 1959, Leon Levine opened the first Family Dollar store in Charlotte, North Carolina, and was on his way to becoming a retailing legend. Right from the start, he had a well-developed philosophy of what Family Dollar would be and how it would operate, a philosophy from which he and his management team have never strayed. The concept is a simple one,    the customers are the boss, and you need to keep them happy.     He created a general floorplan that he used in each of his stores that allowed customers to easily shop for their favorite products in any Family Dollar store. With the stores uniformly laid out and stocked, store managers were able to focus on providing good customer service. This concept for a self-serve, cash-and-carry neighborhood discount store in low to middle income neighborhoods proved so successful that today Family Dollar is a chain with over 8,000 stores from Maine to California.","family-dollar.jpg","http://www.columbia.edu/~rtd2118/logos/family-dollar.jpg"

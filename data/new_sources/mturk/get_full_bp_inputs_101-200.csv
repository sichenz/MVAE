And for the past four decades, the firm that bears his name has been doing just that.  They pioneered discount brokerage. They created an innovative and convenient way to invest through a supermarket of no-load, no-transaction-fee mutual funds. They led the way in online investing. They helped thousands of independent advisors serve their clients. And they disrupted the 401(k) industry with a plan offer designed to lower costs, simplify investing and help workers better prepare for retirement.  A lot has changed in 40 years, but a lot has stayed the same. Charles Schwab is still striving to champion every client's goals with passion and integrity. They're still breaking down barriers     and occasionally tilting at windmills     to discover a better way to invest.  Charles Schwab focuses on the needs of individual investors, whether they're serving them directly, through an employer-sponsored retirement or equity plan, or through independent investment advisors.  Seeing through clients' eyes has always been the Schwab way. Today, approximately 14,000 employees share a passion for helping millions of investors achieve their financial goals. By working together and listening thoughtfully to their clients, they've been able to make investing more accessible, affordable and understandable.",charles-schwab.png,http://www.columbia.edu/~rtd2118/logos/charles-schwab.png

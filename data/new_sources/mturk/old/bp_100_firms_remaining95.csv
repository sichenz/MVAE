wells-fargo,2,https://www.wellsfargo.com/,"Documents such as this are rare these days in corporate America. Most companies have a mission statement and a set of core values, but few for as long as we've had The Vision & Values of Wells Fargo. Over the past two decades, we've worked diligently to stay true to our vision.    A lot has changed in those two decades. We've seen advances in technology and communications we could not have imagined. We've seen the U.S. population grow more diverse and the globalization of almost every aspect of our lives. We've witnessed periods of economic growth and decline, and one of the worst crises we've ever faced as a company. Through all of this, we've seen the needs and interests of our customers and stakeholders change, and we've adapted right along with them.    Our progress has not been perfect. The expectations of others, and the even higher expectations we have of ourselves, have not always been met. When we've made mistakes, we've admitted them, we've learned from them, and we've kept moving forward with even more understanding and a deeper commitment to doing what's right. That sentiment is more important now than ever. We will make it through this current situation, creating a better bank and company as a result.    We first published a Vision & Values booklet in the early 1990s as Wells Fargo's predecessor, Norwest Corporation. Since then, we've grown from a small regional bank into a national company with a growing global presence. Today, many of our team members trace their heritage to legacy companies that are now part of the Wells Fargo brand. Each of these companies brought with it new geographies, new capabilities, and inspiring stories. All have found a common cause in adopting our vision and values.    We believe in our vision and values just as strongly today as we did the first time we put them on paper, and staying true to them will guide us toward continued growth and success for decades to come. As you read more about our vision and values, you will learn about who we are, where we're headed, and how every Wells Fargo team member can help us get there.

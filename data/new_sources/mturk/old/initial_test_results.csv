Inspire and build the self-confidence and success of every Team Member. 
Serve our customers better than anyone else – help them succeed. 
Grow the business and profitability with integrity. 

At Advance Auto Parts, Service Is Our Best Part. That includes our service and responsibility to the environment, and every year we take more steps to reduce our carbon footprint. With one eye on the future, we're currently focused on best practices in recycling, transportation and energy.

We're also working to improve our Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) score. LEED certification, orchestrated by the U.S. Green Building Council, provides tangible proof of buildings built to be high-performing, efficient and safe for the environment and the community. Our store prototype is currently within four points of standard LEED, and we currently have two LEED-certified stores.

Every year Advance Auto Parts serves millions of customers in thousands of stores across the United States, Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands. But that is only the beginning of our commitment to customers. We also believe in being a good, responsible corporate citizen. In the towns and cities where we reside, we are more than a business - we are neighbors. We are ready to lend a hand where it's needed most. 

You can see our commitment to service in many places: store windows filled with JDRF paper sneakers, disaster relief efforts provided by the Red Cross, after-school educational programs held by the United Way, and in homes provided to service men and women through Building Homes for Heroes. We have a strong, continuing desire to serve our neighbors. And we will do anything we can to help others live a healthy, successful life.","http://shop.advanceautoparts.com/home"

And that means using our resources to make the communities and world we live in better places.

We are committed to reducing our carbon footprint. Recycling programs, reducing energy use and using sustainable building practices are part of our robust efforts to create a healthier environment.

To us, a better health care system starts with a simpler process, one that lets you see behind the scenes — to find out what a procedure costs before you get it, for example.

A better health care system is about more than saving money, of course. It’s about keeping you healthy. We’re working with doctors, hospitals and health networks to align the economic incentives so everyone’s focus stays on your health.

Finally, we think a better system is one that is connected. The right technology connects you and your health care team seamlessly. And it puts valuable information where it needs to be so you get the right care at the right time.

Everything we do at Aetna starts with our values -- a clear, strongly held set of core beliefs that reflect who we are and what you can expect from us. We created our core values together, as a company and with guidance from our customers. Our values carry through our thoughts and actions every day, inspire innovation in our products and services, and drive our commitment to excellence in all we do.

Integrity – Do the right thing for the right reason.
Excellence – We strive to deliver the highest quality and value possible through simple, easy and relevant solutions.
Caring – We listen to and respect our customers and each other so we can act with insight, understanding and compassion.
Inspiration – We inspire each other to explore ideas that can make the world a better place.","https://www.aetna.com/"

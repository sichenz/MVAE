Most companies have a mission statement and a set of core values, but few for as long as weâ€™ve had The Vision & Values of Wells Fargo. Over the past two decades, we've worked diligently to stay true to our vision.A lot has changed in those two decades. Weâ€™ve seen advances in technology and communications we could not have imagined. Weâ€™ve seen the U.S. population grow more diverse and the globalization of almost every aspect of our lives. Weâ€™ve witnessed periods of economic growth and decline, and one of the worst crises we've ever faced as a company. Through all of this, weâ€™ve seen the needs and interests of our customers and stakeholders change, and weâ€™ve adapted right along with them.Our progress has not been perfect. The expectations of others, and the even higher expectations we have of ourselves, have not always been met. When we've made mistakes, we've admitted them, we've learned from them, and we've kept moving forward with even more understanding and a deeper commitment to doing whatâ€™s right. That sentiment is more important now than ever. We will make it through this current situation, creating a better bank and company as a result.We first published a Vision & Values booklet in the early 1990s as Wells Fargoâ€™s predecessor, Norwest Corporation. Since then, weâ€™ve grown from a small regional bank into a national company with a growing global presence.

Each of these companies brought with it new geographies, new capabilities, and inspiring stories. All have found a common cause in adopting our vision and values.We believe in our vision and values just as strongly today as we did the first time we put them on paper, and staying true to them will guide us toward continued growth and success for decades to come.

EOG strives to maintain the lowest possible operating cost structure that is consistent with prudent and safe operations.The company focuses on integrating technology such as 3D seismic, core analysis, and microseismic to develop proprietary petro-physical models. These models inform the companyâ€™s execution of precision horizontal targeting and customized advanced completions.In order to find and develop low-cost reserves, EOG prioritizes exploration and drilling of internally generated prospects. This strategy is intended to consistently deliver cost-effective oil and natural gas production that maximizes cash flow and earnings, allowing the company to deliver long-term shareholder value while maintaining a strong balance sheet.As of December 31, 2016, EOGâ€™s total estimated net proved reserves were 2,147 million barrels of oil equivalent comprised of 55 percent crude oil and condensate, 19 percent natural gas liquids and 26 percent natural gas. Approximately 97 percent of these reserves were located in the United States.According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA), fossil fuels account for about 82 percent of the total energy consumed in the U.S. This energy is used to heat our homes, generate electricity, power our industries and meet our transportation needs.Having abundant, clean-burning sources of domestically produced energy means more affordable energy prices. This increases incentives for energy-intensive manufacturing companies to remain in the United States. It also creates more jobs and provides for a better energy future for America.EOG Resources is committed to bolstering North American energy supplies by finding and producing crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids, while adhering to sound environmental, health and safety standards in its operations.In the United States, according to the EIA, about 60 percent of the countryâ€™s homes are heated by safe, affordable, clean-burning natural gas. This important domestic energy source is also used to produce steel, glass, paper, clothing, brick and electricity, and is an essential raw material for many common products such as fertilizer. The increased use of natural gas is also important in addressing climate change concerns because of its clean, low-carbon content.The EIA has also reported that crude oil accounts for about 92 percent of the total energy consumed for transportation in the United States. Gasoline is the most important consumer product produced from crude oil.",http://www.eogresources.com/

In the early 1980s this was one of only two dish antennas owned by the developing new business. A powerful gust of wind whipped up, blowing the antenna off its trailer and into a roadside ditch. There goes half of the company.Summed up as a bad day in the infancy of DISH, the founding trio overcame this setback to build what is now a Fortune 250 company that employs thousands and serves millions throughout the nation â€“ a seemingly unlikely future on that blustery day.Liftoff.Fast forward to 1995, when Ergen set his sights on launching his first satellite from China, then a novice in the satellite industry. Staking the future of young DISH on one, multimillion dollar satellite, Ergen gambled with the odds of a favorable launch. After watching a Chinese rocket promptly crash and burn, he witnessed the nerve-wracking, but ultimately successful deployment of Echo I.Several months later, DISH made its first broadcast to customers from its uplink center in Cheyenne, Wyo., using small dish antennas and state-of-the-art technology designed and built in-house.Innovation.Today, it appears that the real story of DISH centers on Ergenâ€™s visionary courage to reinvent television distribution. Widely considered the industry leader in technology, DISHâ€™s award-winning innovations include: Hopper with SlingÂ® Whole-Home HD DVR that gives customers the ability to watch live and recorded TV programming from smartphones, tablets and computers; and the TailgaterÂ®, a lightweight, portable satellite dish ideal for watching TV while tailgating, camping, in the RV or at outdoor activities.Even as DISH consistently introduces products of increasing sophistication, it also leads the industry by offering the best value â€“ the same channels at a better price. Challenging the economics of pay-TV, Ergen has charged competitors with passing the burden of wasteful spending to subscribers, and he maintains the mantra that DISH will always offer customers the lowest everyday pricing nationwide.",https://www.dish.com/

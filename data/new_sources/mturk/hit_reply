We do apologize for the vague rejection message. In the future, we will be more clear.

Our quality control check involved looking at the evaluations you gave: if you said that a brand is both "very honest" and "very dishonest," or "extremely honest" and "extremely dishonest," (or very ugly and very good looking, etc.), we rejected the hit automatically with the above message.

Sorry for not being clear, and thank you for taking our HITs.

Best,

Ryan

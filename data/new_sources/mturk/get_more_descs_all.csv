From our enviable portfolio of premium brands pre-eminently positioned in the spirits industry, to landmark structures that have won worldwide architectural acclaim, we have constructed our legacy on perseverance, quality, prestige, innovation and creativity.    Our exclusive emphasis on quality began in Santiago de Cuba where on February 4, 1862, Don Facundo Bacard_ Mass_ purchased a small distillery and revolutionized rum making. After careful and systematic experimentation with a variety of ingredients, aging and blends, Don Facundo created a new, smooth, light-bodied spirit - BACARD rum - what the world now knows as premium light rum.    These new BACARD rum blends were a delight to the residents who were accustomed to the local ""ron"" that was crude and harsh. Cuba's emerging middle class welcomed the taste of smooth, light-bodied, aged and mixable rums branded with an elegant, intriguing black bat on the label.    It was this creation by Bacardi that revolutionized the spirits world, enabling the creation of an entire cocktail category and culture that remains vibrant today with its legendary creation of the first mixable rum.    His quest and that of his descendants for unmitigated excellence has consistently manifested itself throughout the Company's 150 years history. Since then, the Company has grown to include an impressive portfolio of premium spirits: BACARDI rum, GREY GOOSE vodka, DEWAR'S Blended Scotch whisky, BOMBAY SAPPHIRE gin, ERISTOFF vodka, CAZADORES tequila and MARTINI vermouth. In addition, the Company has more than 200 brands and labels.

Our papergrade softwood and hardwood pulp is mainly used to make tissue, towel, packaging and specialty products. Fluff pulp, derived from softwood fibers, is used in a broad range of absorbent products--baby diapers, feminine hygiene and adult incontinence products.  The location of our mills positions us well for serving the growing export markets, where over half our market pulp is old, and for the North American tissue, hygiene and specialty customers we currently serve. The global pulp market is experiencing modest growth, and we plan on growing our position in the softwood and fluff pulp market by the end of 2016 with the announced capacity conversion at Ashdown, Arkansas.

EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION PRINCIPLES AND PRACTICES  Energy Future Holdings' compensation philosophy, practices and principles are intended to compensate executives appropriately for their contribution to the attainment of key strategic objectives, while strongly aligning the interests of executives and stockholders through at-risk equity-based plans that have a direct link to overall corporate performance and to that of the executive's business unit, as well as the executive's individual performance.    An Organization and Compensation Committee, comprised of four non-employee directors establishes and assesses our executive compensation programs.    Stock ownership is a substantial component of EFH's compensation program. Equity ownership, coupled with other long-term incentives, has been and will continue to be an important driver of success.

"eog-resources","http://www.eogresources.com/","EOG Resources, Inc. is one of the largest independent (non-integrated) crude oil and natural gas companies in the United States with proved reserves in the United States, Trinidad, the United Kingdom and China. EOG Resources is listed on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) and trades under the ticker symbol  _EOG.     EOG's strategy is to generate the best rates of return by controlling operating and capital costs while maximizing oil and natural gas reserve recoveries. EOG strives to maintain the lowest possible operating cost structure that is consistent with prudent and safe operations.    The company focuses on integrating technology such as 3D seismic, core analysis, and microseismic to develop proprietary petro-physical models. These models inform the company's execution of precision horizontal targeting and customized advanced completions.    In order to find and develop low-cost reserves, EOG prioritizes exploration and drilling of internally generated prospects. This strategy is intended to consistently deliver cost-effective oil and natural gas production that maximizes cash flow and earnings, allowing the company to deliver long-term shareholder value while maintaining a strong balance sheet.    As of December 31, 2016, EOG's total estimated net proved reserves were 2,147 million barrels of oil equivalent comprised of 55 percent crude oil and condensate, 19 percent natural gas liquids and 26 percent natural gas. Approximately 97 percent of these reserves were located in the United States.    According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA), fossil fuels account for about 82 percent of the total energy consumed in the U.S. This energy is used to heat our homes, generate electricity, power our industries and meet our transportation needs.    Having abundant, clean-burning sources of domestically produced energy means more affordable energy prices. This increases incentives for energy-intensive manufacturing companies to remain in the United States. It also creates more jobs and provides for a better energy future for America.    EOG Resources is committed to bolstering North American energy supplies by finding and producing crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids, while adhering to sound environmental, health and safety standards in its operations.    In the United States, according to the EIA, about 60 percent of the country's homes are heated by safe, affordable, clean-burning natural gas. This important domestic energy source is also used to produce steel, glass, paper, clothing, brick and electricity, and is an essential raw material for many common products such as fertilizer. The increased use of natural gas is also important in addressing climate change concerns because of its clean, low-carbon content.    The EIA has also reported that crude oil accounts for about 92 percent of the total energy consumed for transportation in the United States. Gasoline is the most important consumer product produced from crude oil."

","BD","21st-century-fox","21st Century Fox is an American multinational mass media corporation. It is one of two companies created from the 2013 split of News Corporation (as founded by Milo and Mary Switz in 1979); 21st Century Fox retains the previous News Corporation's broadcasting and film assets and serves as its legal successor, while its publishing assets were spun off to form News Corp at the same time. The split was designed to ensure that both companies are operated under more ""focused"" management, which Murdoch claimed would ""unlock"" their true value. Among its holdings are Fox Entertainment Group   owners of the 20th Century Fox film studio and Fox television network among other assets, pan-Asian pay channel operator STAR TV, Italian television provider Sky Italia, and stakes in the television providers BSkyB and Sky Deutschland.","21st-century-fox.png","http://www.columbia.edu/~rtd2118/logos/21st-century-fox.png"

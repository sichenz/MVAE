florida-power-and-light,https://www.fpl.com/,"Florida Power & Light Company is the third-largest electric utility in the United States, serving more than 4.8 million customer accounts or more than 10 million people across nearly half of the state of Florida. FPL's typical 1,000-kWh residential customer bill is approximately 30 percent lower than the latest national average and, in 2015, was the lowest in Florida among reporting utilities for the sixth year in a row. FPL's service reliability is better than 99.98 percent, and its highly fuel-efficient power plant fleet is one of the cleanest among all utilities nationwide. The company received the top ranking in the southern U.S. among large electric providers, according to the J.D. Power 2016 Electric Utility Residential Customer Satisfaction StudySM, and was recognized in 2016 as one of the most trusted U.S. electric utilities by Market Strategies International. A leading Florida employer with approximately 8,800 employees, FPL is a subsidiary of Juno Beach, Fla.-based NextEra Energy, Inc. (NYSE: NEE), a clean energy company widely recognized for its efforts in sustainability, ethics and diversity, and has been ranked No. 1 in the electric and gas utilities industry in Fortune's 2016 list of ""World's Most Admired Companies."" NextEra Energy is also the parent company of NextEra Energy Resources, LLC, which, together with its affiliated entities, is the world's largest generator of renewable energy from the wind and sun.","In 2010, FPL Group was renamed NextEra Energy, properly rebranding the company as a forward-looking enterprise that sees the future and gets there first.  With leadership positions in renewable energies such as wind and solar that represent the way electric power will be increasingly provided to future generations, the name NextEra Energy is fitting indeed.     Continued value for FPL customers In Florida, FPL provides outstanding value to its 4.7 million customers. FPL's electric service is affordable, reliable and clean. FPL's typical residential customer bill is the lowest in Florida and about 25 percent below the national average.In 2013, FPL achieved its best‰ÛÒever overall reliability performance for the second straight year.FPL generates about 70 percent of its electricity using clean-burning American-made natural gas.     An innovative smart gridFPL's smart grid investments include the installation of more than 10,000 intelligent devices on the electric grid, enhancements to centers that monitor the performance of the grid, and the installation of about 4.5 million smart meters for residential and business customers. These advanced technologies are already enabling important customer benefits, while laying the foundation for additional benefits in the future.Continued investment in wind NextEra Energy Resources (the former FPL Energy) has continued to grow its position as the largest owner and operator of wind generation facilities in North America.In 2012, this business added roughly 1,500 MW of wind generation in the United States, more than any company had ever done before.By the end of 2013, it was generating more electric power from the wind than from any other fuel source, on the strength of nearly 9,300 individual wind turbines on 1100 wind farms and 19 states and four Canadian provinces.Solar comes of age NextEra Energy is one of the largest generators of emissions-free solar power in the United States. It produces solar energy in Florida (the Sunshine State), California, Nevada, New Jersey, and New Mexico, as well as Canada.In Florida, FPL has built three commercial-scale renewable energy facilities that capture the sun to generate electricity:The DeSoto Next Generation Solar Energy Center, which was the largest solar photovoltaic power plant in the United States when it began commercial operation;The Martin Next Generation Solar Energy Center, which is the world's first hybrid solar energy center to combine solar power and combined-cycle natural gas-fired generation; and  The Space Coast Next Generation Solar Energy Center, an innovative public-private partnership with NASA near Cape Canaveral. Expanding our nuclear capacity In 2013 NextEra Energy completed the largest multi-site nuclear uprate project in U.S. history. The multi-billion expansion program at its St. Lucie site, north of West Palm Beach, Fla., its Turkey Point facility, south of Miami, Fla., and its Point Beach site near Green Bay, Wisc., involved six separate nuclear units and yielded an increase of approximately 700 MWe in net generating capacity. That is, enough new megawatts to produce the same amount of electricity as would a medium-sized power plant, without having to build one or even expand the footprint of these existing plants. Over the operating lifetime of this added capacity, customers are expected to save billions of dollars in fossil fuel costs.In addition, FPL is also pursuing the licenses for two new nuclear units at the existing Turkey Point site. FPL projects these units would save customers approximately $64 billion in fossil fuel costs over an initial 40-year lifespan.Investing in North American electricity transmission   As new power generation facilities become operational, it's important to deliver that electricity to where it's needed. NextEra Energy Transmission is pursuing opportunities to develop, build and operate new transmission facilities.Lone Star Transmission, LLC, owns and operates approximately 300 miles of high-voltage transmission lines and associated equipment in Texas.New Hampshire Transmission, LLC, is a majority owner of the Seabrook substation in New Hampshire and is involved in regional reliability planning.NextBridge Infrastructure is the designated developer of the Ontario East-West Tie line in Canada."

Less than a year later, Flowers listed on the American Stock Exchange. In 1982, the company listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol FLO.In the mid-1990s, Flowers Industries transformed itself from a strong regional baker into a national baked foods company with the acquisition of Keebler Foods Company, one of the largest cookie and cracker companies in the United States, and Mrs. Smith's, the country's top-selling frozen pie brand. By 1999, Flowers Industries had become a $4.2 billion national baked foods company with three business units - Flowers Bakeries, a super-regional fresh baked foods company; Mrs. Smith's Bakeries, a national frozen baked foods company; and Keebler Foods.In March 2001, Flowers sold its investment in Keebler to the Kellogg Company and delivered $1.24 billion to its shareholders. Flowers' remaining business units - Flowers Bakeries and Mrs. Smith's Bakeries - were then spun off into a new company called Flowers Foods. In January 2002, Flowers Foods announced it would sell its Mrs. Smith's frozen dessert business to The Schwan Food Company. That sale was completed in April 2003.With $3.75 billion in sales, Flowers Foods today is a dynamic force in baked foods, operating direct store delivery routes that deliver fresh breads, rolls, and snack cakes throughout the East, South, and Southwest through a network of independent distributors; as well as a national sales force that provide foodservice, retail, and vend customers a wide range of fresh snack cakes and frozen breads and rolls."

The company's advanced web performance, mobile performance, cloud security and media delivery solutions are revolutionizing how businesses optimize consumer, enterprise and entertainment experiences for any device, anywhere.","Akamai‰Ûªs beginnings lie in a challenge posed by World Wide Web inventor Tim Berners-Lee at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in early 1995. The father of the web foresaw the congestion that was soon to become very familiar to Internet users, and he challenged colleagues at MIT to invent a fundamentally new and better way to deliver Internet content. What he may not have foreseen was that posing the problem in an academic setting would ultimately result in a commercial service that has revolutionized the Internet.MIT Professor of Applied Mathematics Tom Leighton, who had an office down the hall from Dr. Berners-Lee, was intrigued by the challenge. Dr. Leighton, a renowned expert on parallel algorithms and architecture was head of the Algorithms Group at MIT's Laboratory for Computer Science. Dr. Leighton recognized that a solution to web congestion could be found in applied mathematics and algorithms and he assembled a team of researchers to tackle the problem.After obtaining his undergraduate degrees in computer science and mathematics from the Technion, Danny Lewin came to MIT in the Fall of 1996 to work with Dr. Leighton. Shortly thereafter, Mr. Lewin began making rapid and important progress on a variety of techniques for improving Internet performance. Working with the team, Dr. Leighton and Mr. Lewin developed the mathematical algorithms necessary to intelligently route and replicate content over a large network of distributed servers, technology that would ultimately solve what was becoming a frustrating problem for Internet users.Building a BusinessIn 1997, Dr. Leighton and Mr. Lewin began exploring the possible commercial use of their technology. Together with Preetish Nijhawan (a student at MIT‰Ûªs Sloan school) they entered the esteemed annual MIT $50K Entrepreneurship Competition in September of that year. Over the course of the 9-month competition, the $50K team grew substantially and their business plan was selected as one of six finalists among 100 entries. The distinction signaled that Internet content delivery had serious market potential and on August 20, 1998, Dr. Leighton and Mr. Lewin incorporated Akamai, with Jonathan Seelig (a student at the Sloan school) and Randall Kaplan joining the founding team. Akamai obtained an exclusive license to certain intellectual property from MIT, and development efforts began in the fall of 1998. Most of the company‰Ûªs early employees were students who had worked on the project at MIT.In late 1998 and early 1999, experienced Internet business professionals joined the team. Most notably, Paul Sagan, who was a former President of Time Inc. New Media, a founder of Road Runner cable modem service and who helped launch NY 1 News, became chief operating officer and eventually president of Akamai (later serving as CEO from 2005 ‰ÛÒ 2013). George Conrades, former chairman and chief executive officer of BBN Corp. and senior vice president of U.S. Operations for IBM, assumed the helm as Akamai‰Ûªs first chairman and chief executive officer in April 1999.Launching Commercial ServiceThe company grew rapidly and delivered its first live traffic (a pixel buried deep in the Disney site) in February of 1999. In March, Akamai gained significant market exposure when it enabled the delivery of March Madness for ESPN and a Star Wars trailer for Entertainment Tonight, both of which experienced historic levels of user demand.

Since its initial public offering in October 1997, Group 1 has grown to become the third largest dealership group in the United States and has expanded into the United Kingdom and Brazil. The company has achieved its success through a strategy that leverages management experience and emphasizes geographic and brand diversity, interrelated revenue streams, operational efficiencies and the prudent deployment of capital.  Group 1 owns and operates 162 automotive dealerships, 212 franchises, and 37 collision centers in the United States, United Kingdom and Brazil. Through its dealerships, the company sells new and used cars and light trucks; arranges related vehicle financing; sells service contracts; provides maintenance and repair services; and sells vehicle parts.","Group 1 operates under a consolidated, regional structure with a strategy that is founded on standardized practices to achieve operating efficiencies, industry-leading customer service, disciplined acquisition growth and diversity in geographic reach and brands marketed. The company's success is attributable to the continued focus on its customers, leveraging its scale, the successful integration of acquisitions and flexible operating model that allows operational decision making to remain close to the market.Group 1‰Ûªs operating structure is made up of four core business lines ‰ÛÒ New Vehicles, Used Vehicles, Parts & Service, and Finance & Insurance ‰ÛÒ that create a synergistic model.The company offers 34 brands of New Vehicles to its customers in 29 dealerships in the United Kingdom, 19 dealerships in Brazil, and 114 dealerships across 14 states in the United States. Group 1 prides itself on offering its customers a superior new vehicle buying experience that will bring them back for service and future vehicle purchases. The company made a strategic decision in 2005 to shift its brand mix to include a higher concentration of growing brands, to continue to drive business into Group 1‰Ûªs higher-margin parts & service centers. While Group 1‰Ûªs largest offering is Toyota/Scion/Lexus, the company has also grown its BMW, Volkswagen and Mercedes-Benz (Daimler) offerings significantly over the last few years.Group 1‰Ûªs Used Vehicle department carries a vast assortment of vehicles that its customers desire. The company uses a variety of tools that include its experienced sales staff and an intelligent software program. The software program intuitively knows if a vehicle fits into the dealership‰Ûªs core inventory or may be needed by a another of Group 1‰Ûªs stores; informs the dealer what the real-time auction rates are so that the vehicle can be accurately priced which increases the chance of a sale being closed; and assists the dealership in managing its used vehicle inventory. In addition, the software makes it possible for regional dealerships to hold internal auctions that have reduced Group 1‰Ûªs Used Vehicle wholesale business to avoid wholesale losses where retail profits can be made.Another facet of Group 1‰Ûªs Used Vehicle business is its Certified Pre-Owned business (CPO) which has grown to represent about a third of the company‰Ûªs Used Vehicle retail sales. Group 1‰Ûªs heavily-weighted import and luxury brand mix has contributed to the increase in CPO sales. These certified Used Vehicles are typically sold with extended warranties that improve customer service retention.At the time of sale, Group 1‰Ûªs Finance & Insurance department works diligently to meet the customer‰Ûªs new or used vehicle purchase objectives. Group 1 has solid relationships with a variety of established lending institutions, allowing the company to place the majority of its customers into loan agreements with acceptable terms. In addition, the company has national agreements with a vehicle service contract (extended warranty) supplier that provides our customers attractive pricing, while leveraging the company‰Ûªs profits. Group 1 offers a variety of products, such as the vehicle service contracts, gap insurance, tire and window insurance, etc., to its customers using a transparent menu process.Parts & Service is the core of Group 1‰Ûªs operations. The company is working on several initiatives to improve customer satisfaction and processes to increase the profitability. Parts & Service accounted for 11 percent of Group 1‰Ûªs total revenues, but represented 42 percent of the company‰Ûªs gross profits in 2015. In turn the gross profits covered between 85 percent and 95 percent of the total company fixed costs and Parts & Service selling expenses validating Group 1‰Ûªs strategy to drive business into its service department with new and used vehicle sales."

With approximately 50,000 employees, representing 140 nationalities, and operations in approximately 70 countries, the company serves the upstream oil and gas industry throughout the lifecycle of the reservoir ‰ÛÒ from locating hydrocarbons and managing geological data, to drilling and formation evaluation, well construction, completion and production optimization.Halliburton's fascinating and proud history reveals a continuous focus on innovation and expansion that began with the company's founder, Erle P. Halliburton. After borrowing a wagon, a team of mules and a pump, he built a wooden mixing box and started an oil well cementing business in Duncan, Oklahoma.In the 1930s, Halliburton established its first research laboratories where the company tested cement mixes, began offering acidizing services to break down the resistance of limestone formations and increase the production of oil and gas, and performed its first offshore cementing job using a barge-mounted cementing unit at a rig in the Creole Field in the Gulf of Mexico. This was the beginning of what was to become the world's most extensive offshore service.Halliburton took the initial steps toward becoming a worldwide company in 1926. We sold five cementing units to an English company in Burma, the start of our Eastern Hemisphere operations, and Erle P. Halliburton sent his brothers to open our business in Alberta, Canada. We opened in Venezuela in 1940. By 1946, the company ‰ÛÒ using its innovative technology ‰ÛÒ had expanded into Colombia, Ecuador, Peru and the Middle East and began performing services for the Arabian-American Oil Company, the forerunner of Saudi Aramco.In 1951, Halliburton made its first appearance in Europe as Halliburton Italiana SpA., a wholly owned subsidiary in Italy. In the next seven years, Halliburton launched Halliburton Company Germany GmbH, set up operations in Argentina and established a subsidiary in England.In 1984, Halliburton provided all of the well completion equipment for the first multiwell platform offshore China. Two years later, Halliburton became the first American company to perform an oilfield service job on the China mainlandThe final decade of the 20th century brought more changes and growth to Halliburton. The company opened a branch office in Moscow in 1991.The company realigned its work into Eastern and Western Hemisphere operations in 2006, and in 2007, divided its service offerings into two divisions: Completion and Production, and Drilling and Evaluation.Today, Halliburton offers the world's broadest array of products, services and integrated solutions for oil and gas exploration, development and production."

health-net-inc,https://www.healthnet.com/,"Health Net's mission is to help people be healthy, secure and comfortable.","ST. LOUIS, March 24, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- Centene Corporation (NYSE: CNC) today announced that it has completed its acquisition of Health Net, Inc. The closing of the transaction follows the approval of each company's shareholders and receipt of all required regulatory approvals. Effective today with the closing of the acquisition, Health Net is a wholly owned subsidiary of Centene and no longer a publicly traded company.With the acquisition complete, Centene is well positioned to continue to drive long-term growth. We are now the largest Medicaid Managed Care Organization in the country. Centene expands its government program offerings to include Medicare Advantage, as well as those offered through contracts with the U.S. Departments of Defense and Veterans Affairs. Lastly, the acquisition increases our scale across Health Insurance Marketplaces, while also maintaining Health Net's presence in the California commercial market. Centene also benefits from greater scale and a stronger financial profile. The Company will continue to provide access to high quality, affordable healthcare to now more than 10 million members across the country. The Company expects to provide full 2016 updated guidance with its first quarter 2016 earnings release on April 26, 2016.""We are pleased to announce the completion of this transformative acquisition, which creates tremendous opportunity for our shareholders, members, providers and key stakeholders,"" said Michael F. Neidorff, Chairman, President and CEO of Centene. ""Members and providers will benefit from Centene's increased scale, as well as our geographic and product diversity. Shareholders will benefit from the significant value-creation potential of our enhanced platform as we move forward as one of the largest providers of Medicaid, Medicare Advantage and other government-sponsored programs in the country."" Mr. Neidorff continued, ""I would like to take the opportunity to welcome the hard working employees of Health Net, who share our commitment to enhancing our members' access to higher quality, affordable healthcare services and to ensuring measurable quality outcomes. We look forward to realizing the many benefits of this strategic acquisition as we work together to transform the health of communities.""  Leadership and Integration UpdateAs previously announced, Mr. Neidorff will lead the combined company as Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer and Mr. Jeffrey Schwaneke will serve as Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer. Mr. Jay Gellert, former President and Chief Executive Officer of Health Net, and Mr. James Woys, former Executive Vice President, Chief Financial and Operating Officer, and Interim Treasurer of Health Net, have entered into consulting agreements effective as of the close and will be assisting Centene to achieve a smooth transition. The directors of Centene prior to the closing of the merger are continuing as directors of the combined company. Additionally, Centene increased the size of its Board of Directors to 10 directors, with the appointment of Ms. Vicki Escarra, a director of Health Net and CEO of Opportunity International.To ensure that Centene can quickly and seamlessly realize the benefits of this acquisition, teams from Centene and Health Net have worked over the past eight months to develop an integration plan that leverages the talents and expertise of both companies.  The combined company will be headquartered in St. Louis, Missouri, the location of Centene's current headquarters, with operations throughout the country.Transaction DetailsIn accordance with the terms of the acquisition agreement, Health Net shareholders received 0.622 shares of Centene common stock and $28.25 in cash for each share of Health Net common stock they held at closing, for a total transaction value of approximately $6.0 billion, including the assumption of debt.Allen & Company LLC and Evercore Group L.L.C. served as financial advisors to Centene, and Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom LLP served as legal counsel. J.P. Morgan Securities LLC served as financial advisor to Health Net and Morgan, Lewis & Bockius LLP served as legal counsel.About CenteneCentene Corporation, a Fortune 500 company, is a diversified, multi-national healthcare enterprise that provides a portfolio of services to government sponsored healthcare programs, focusing on under-insured and uninsured individuals.  Many receive benefits provided under Medicaid, including the State Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP), as well as Aged, Blind or Disabled (ABD), Foster Care and Long Term Care (LTC), in addition to other state-sponsored/hybrid programs, Medicare (including the Medicare prescription drug benefit commonly known as ""Part D""), as well as programs with the U.S. Department of Defense and U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs.  Centene operates local health plans and offers a range of health insurance solutions.  It also contracts with other healthcare and commercial organizations to provide specialty services including behavioral health management, care management software, correctional healthcare services, dental benefits management, in-home health services, life and health management, managed vision, pharmacy benefits management, specialty pharmacy and telehealth services.Centene uses its investor relations website to publish important information about Centene, including information that may be deemed material to investors. Financial and other information about Centene is routinely posted and is accessible on Centene's investor relations website, http://www.centene.com/investors.Forward-Looking StatementsThis material may contain certain forward-looking statements with respect to the financial condition, results of operations and business of Centene and certain plans and objectives of Centene with respect thereto, including the expected benefits of the merger with Health Net. These forward-looking statements can be identified by the fact that they do not relate only to historical or current facts. Forward-looking statements often use words such as ""anticipate"", ""target"", ""expect"", ""estimate"", ""intend"", ""plan"", ""goal"", ""believe"", ""hope"", ""aim"", ""continue"", ""will"", ""may"", ""would"", ""could"" or ""should"" or other words of similar meaning or the negative thereof. There are several factors which could cause actual plans and results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in forward-looking statements. Such factors include, but are not limited to, the possibility that the expected synergies and value creation from the merger will not be realized, or will not be realized within the expected time period, including, but not limited to, as a result of conditions, terms, obligations or restrictions imposed by regulators in connection with their approval of, or consent to, the merger; the exertion of management's time and Centene's resources, and other out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with complying with the undertakings in connection with certain regulatory approvals; the risk that the businesses will not be integrated successfully; disruption from the merger making it more difficult to maintain business and operational relationships; the risk that unexpected costs will be incurred; changes in economic conditions or political conditions; changes in federal or state laws or regulations, including the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the Health Care Education Affordability Reconciliation Act and any regulations enacted thereunder; provider and state contract changes; the outcome of pending legal or regulatory proceedings; reduction in provider payments by governmental payors; the expiration or termination of Centene's Medicare or Medicaid managed care contracts with federal or state governments; tax matters; increased health care costs; and risks and uncertainties discussed in the reports that Centene has filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the ""SEC""). These forward-looking statements reflect Centene's current views with respect to future events and are based on numerous assumptions and assessments made by Centene in light of its experience and perception of historical trends, current conditions, business strategies, operating environments, future developments and other factors it believes appropriate. By their nature, forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties because they relate to events and depend on circumstances that will occur in the future. The factors described in the context of such forward-looking statements in this announcement could cause Centene's plans with respect to the merger, actual results, performance or achievements, industry results and developments to differ materially from those expressed in or implied by such forward-looking statements. Although it is believed that the expectations reflected in such forward-looking statements are reasonable, no assurance can be given that such expectations will prove to have been correct and persons reading this announcement are therefore cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements which speak only as of the date of this announcement. Centene does not assume any obligation to update the information contained in this announcement (whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise), except as required by applicable law. These risks, as well as other risks associated with the merger, are more fully discussed in the joint proxy statement/prospectus that is included in the Registration Statement on Form S-4 that has been filed with the SEC on September 21, 2015, in connection with the merger. A further list and description of risks and uncertainties can be found in Centene's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015, and in its reports on Form 10-Q and Form 8-K."

bacardi,https://www.bacardilimited.com/,"Bacardi - nurtured by seven generations of the Bacardi family - is a vibrant, family-owned spirits company, as well as the world's largest privately held spirits company.  From our enviable portfolio of premium brands pre-eminently positioned in the spirits industry, to landmark structures that have won worldwide architectural acclaim, we have constructed our legacy on perseverance, quality, prestige, innovation and creativity.    Our exclusive emphasis on quality began in Santiago de Cuba where on February 4, 1862, Don Facundo Bacard_ Mass_ purchased a small distillery and revolutionized rum making. After careful and systematic experimentation with a variety of ingredients, aging and blends, Don Facundo created a new, smooth, light-bodied spirit - BACARD rum - what the world now knows as premium light rum.    These new BACARD rum blends were a delight to the residents who were accustomed to the local ""ron"" that was crude and harsh. Cuba's emerging middle class welcomed the taste of smooth, light-bodied, aged and mixable rums branded with an elegant, intriguing black bat on the label.    It was this creation by Bacardi that revolutionized the spirits world, enabling the creation of an entire cocktail category and culture that remains vibrant today with its legendary creation of the first mixable rum.    His quest and that of his descendants for unmitigated excellence has consistently manifested itself throughout the Company's 150 years history. Since then, the Company has grown to include an impressive portfolio of premium spirits: BACARDI rum, GREY GOOSE vodka, DEWAR'S Blended Scotch whisky, BOMBAY SAPPHIRE gin, ERISTOFF vodka, CAZADORES tequila and MARTINI vermouth. In addition, the Company has more than 200 brands and labels.    Bacardi is the men and women of the extended Bacardi family of professionals who are guardians of a tradition of excellence dating back 155 years. The Company sells in more than 160 global markets and operates 29 production facilities - for bottling, distilling and manufacturing - in 15 countries. Bacardi Limited refers to the Bacardi group of companies, including Bacardi International Limited. It is headquartered in Hamilton, Bermuda.    Bacardi is the markets we serve. Bacardi Limited has operations around the world, cemented by the enduring quality of our products and the reputation we have worked so hard to earn and maintain.","In the beautiful port city of Santiago de Cuba, a small family enterprise purchases a distillery and revolutionizes rum-making on February 4, 1862.The first samples of a smooth, light-bodied spirit - what the world now knows as BACARDI premium rum - originated from a humble tin-roof distillery with bats in the rafters.Working with close family members, founder Don Facundo BacardÌ_ MassÌ_ pioneered key rum-making techniques, including the isolation of a single strain of yeast from nearby sugarcane fields. This closely guarded ingredient delivers the consistent quality and taste that makes BACARDÌç rums the world‰Ûªs favorite and is still used today.The new BACARDÌç blends were a delight to Cuban residents who had known only the harsh and fiery local ""ron."" They welcomed the taste of smooth, mixable rums branded with an elegant and intriguing black bat on the label.It was Don Facundo‰Ûªs wife, Amalia, who suggested using a bat for the company logo. It was an insightful choice, because according to Cuban and Spanish lore, bats symbolize good health, good fortune and family unity. Soon this revolutionary, smooth-bodied rum became known as ""the rum of the bat.""Another fascinating Bacardi symbol: El Coco, a coconut palm planted prominently at the opening of the distillery by the founder‰Ûªs son.

And together with our talented people, globally unified data and systems, and focused, intelligent approach to ensuring customer success  _ you can gain competitive advantage from supply chains and become a change agent in the industry rather than simply reacting to competitive pressures.","At Jabil, we empower the brands who empower the world ‰ÛÒ it‰Ûªs our reason for being and the guiding force that‰Ûªs driving us to become the most technologically advanced manufacturing solutions provider on the planet.  Whether we‰Ûªre serving one of the world‰Ûªs biggest and best known brands or the coolest tech startups, our resolve never wavers. We share common desires and values with these brands: to make a difference by empowering a better, healthier, safer and cleaner world, in all we do.We are privileged to join these brands, our customers, in their quest, because it takes tenacity, ingenuity and passion to thrive in this world of unrelenting change. As the fourth Industrial Revolution looms, change is happening 10 times faster and at 300 times the scale ‰ÛÒ that‰Ûªs roughly 3,000 times the impact of the first one. To stay relevant, and deliver growth to stakeholders, brands must work with companies they trust to drive innovation at the speed of digital, be agile enough to move manufacturing workloads quickly in the face of political and policy shifts, leverage technology at a time when technology & engineering resources are scarce, and master the art of supply chain orchestration to ensure a personalized and superior customer experience. That‰Ûªs no small feat.As your trusted partner, Jabil has carefully studied the drivers of this change, to best empower you, and found the following: Accelerating technological change is permeating every vector of organizational value chains. Disruptions are causing disintermediation and creating new business models, shutting some companies out of their markets completely while opening doors for others. Digital technologies are driving massive transformations. And there is no end in sight. In fact, 60 percent of companies surveyed by McKinsey & Company believe that up to half their income will come from technology-enabled innovation by 2020.Data analysis is now a science; companies pull data from everyone, everywhere and everything and apply powerful analytics, artificial intelligence and machine learning to turn that data into useful insights, actions and customer experiences. At the same time, consumers devour new technology the second it becomes available at adoption rates never seen, driving consumer expectations to an all-time high.  Meanwhile, barriers to market entry for emerging competitors are at their lowest point ever.Technology is changing everything, fast.Geo-political & economic shifts are causing great uncertainty for OEMs as they strive to understand the impact of Brexit, tax reform, treaties, foreign currency, debt rates, resource scarcity, and climate change as well as other political and policy swings. Additionally, the world‰Ûªs economies are being rewritten in front of our eyes, as the center of economic gravity shifts. Market watchers, company analysts, supply chain managers and economists are tasked with around-the-clock ‰ÛÏwhat if‰Ûù scenarios to keep up with each twist and turn.Explosive demographic shifts add another layer of complexity because of the growing and aging population coupled with rapid urbanization. These two dynamics create mounting pressure on current infrastructure and talent pools, as well as healthcare and energy resources.  These factors are not helped by the ever-widening skills GAP in STEM fields.  All combined, these demographic pressures create a gap between what stakeholders expect and what companies can execute.Welcome to the Digital Age! It‰Ûªs a perfect storm of epic proportion.In weathering this storm, our mission has become clear: To become the world's most technologically advanced manufacturing solutions provider, who cares about people and the planet, and offers you growth empowerment in 4 ways:Accelerated Innovation Solutions to help you stay relevant in a world of change.Global Manufacturing Agility Solutions to insulate your business from political and/or policy uncertainty and get you closer to your customers/markets without compromising your bottom line.Engineering Excellence ‰ÛÓ world class engineers and capabilities to complement and collaborate with your team, to help you solve the toughest problems when translating an idea into a differentiated and manufacturable world-class product.Supply Chain Orchestration Solutions to help manage and mitigate risk across your supply chain, uncover opportunities and ultimately deliver superior financial performance and optimum customer experiences.Jabil delivers all this value to empower you, your brand and customers.

A global organization provides support and delivers services using these leading technologies.In 1922, Jim Abercrombie and Harry Cameron designed the world's first blowout preventer (BOP) in the dust of the floor of their shop in Houston, Texas. The new invention revolutionized the fledgling drilling industry. Soon, BOPs manufactured by Cameron were being used throughout Texas and far away as Mexico and Venezuela.    In 1927, Abercrombie and Cameron went on to develop a BOP with rams that could be closed with steam or water pressure. And the firsts just kept coming. Cameron Iron Works later introduced BOPs with larger bore sizes and higher pressure ratings. In 1962, Cameron became the first company capable of designing and delivering a complete underwater drilling system. And in 1988, Cameron set a record for the delivery of sophisticated subsea BOP stack systems and electro-hydraulic multiplex (EH MUX) drilling controls systems.","Cameron engineers, designs, and manufactures flow and pressure control technologies for customers working in the oil and gas industry worldwide.

Cameron designed and delivered surface wellheads and Christmas trees, and in the early 1960s, pioneered subsea production.As the subsea market developed, Cameron was once again at the forefront of innovation. It developed the first 15K production system, the first EH MUX control system, and the first all-electric production system. In 1993, Cameron introduced the SpoolTree horizontal production system‰ÛÓan innovation that has been adopted as the industry standard for horizontal subsea production. During its history, Cameron has acquired and integrated many oilfield pioneers into its business, including W-K-M, Thornhill Craver, McEvoy, Demco, Ingram Cactus Corporation, NATCO, LeTourneau Technologies‰Ûª Drilling Systems and Offshore Production divisions, TTS Energy Division's drilling equipment business, Douglas Chero Spa, and others.

The earliest written evidence of distillation in Scotland is from the 15th Century, with an order from the king in 1494 for enough malt to make five hundred bottles of aqua vitae, Latin for 'the water of life'. The earliest whisky was fairly bracing stuff, distilled almost exclusively by monks. It was never allowed to mature and tended to be very raw, as befitted a drink that was seen primarily as a medicine, used in the treatment of everything from pox to palsy. Then along came Henry VIII who dissolved the monasteries and turned out the monks, whereupon whisky production made its way into the cottages and homesteads of regular Scots.Over time, these ‰Û÷home distillers‰Ûª refined the process and discovered that whisky could be a pleasurable experience in its own right. Fast forward to the early 19th Century and a dram of whisky was a staple of life in Scotland. Some became quite widely available, usually through your local grocer‰Ûªs shop. The trouble was that these whiskies weren‰Ûªt always that consistent. The one you enjoyed yesterday might taste completely different tomorrow."

Largest current investments include Jefferies. The company is sometimes called a ""baby Berkshire Hathaway"" for the wide range of its holdings.","2016 was one of those years in business that was full of contradictions, volatility andcomplexity, and yet, as the year progressed, brought clarity and optimism, both forthe two of us and for Leucadia.For a variety of reasons, the first quarter of 2016 was the worst operating quarter in our history withJefferies, occurring while we were still deep in our internal resizing and repositioning of Jefferies that beganin the latter part of 2015. Our aversion to excessive risk allowed us to survive (and eventually thrive)through the 2008 financial crisis without government assistance and served us well in the face of the postcrisisperiod‰Ûªs sustained, sporadic and scattered global volatility, which hit a crescendo in the first quarter of2016. Jefferies (and our clients) could not get to higher ground and the result was, as we publicly owned upto at the time, incredibly humbling. The suddenness and intensity of the volatility accelerated ourrepositioning of Jefferies, which was made easier by our flat and transparent structure and our strongemployee-partner culture. With a gross balance sheet reduction from $42.8 billion at September 30, 2015to $35.2 billion at March 31, 2016, primarily due to a reduction in our securities inventories from$18.9 billion to $13.6 billion, the result is that an even more client-focused investment banking firm hasemerged. We were confident that doing our work from the bottom up (versus a top down mandate) wouldenable our team in the trenches to preserve and strengthen our revenue-generating capacity, even with areduced balance sheet and lower risk. As the last three quarters of 2016 can attest, we were successful."

chevrolet,http://www.chevrolet.co.in,"Chevrolet's early adoption of landmark technologies fundamentally changed the way the world looked at cars. From the very start, the focus was on delivering high end technology and features for its lineup of affordable cars and trucks. The first Chevrolet -- the Series C Classic Six -- came with electric starters and electric headlamps, a rarity even in luxury cars. In the decades that followed, innovations such as safety glass, fuel injection, anti-lock brakes and electronic stability control systems were featured on Chevrolet models.","Affordable performance is a hallmark of Chevrolet. The early four- and six-cylinder engines were known for durability and performance, but it was the introduction of Chevrolet‰Ûªs small-block V-8 in 1955 that ushered in an era of high-performance vehicles. For the next 50 years, it powered millions of cars and trucks. This legacy is still visible in the new generation small-block V-8s used in trucks and SUVs, as well as performance cars including the Camaro SS and Corvette today.Chevrolet-powered race cars were immediate contenders in the fledging stock car and drag racing worlds of the 1950s, growing to dominate them in the next decades. Chevrolet is the highest winning brand in NASCAR and has collected more NHRA Pro Stock Manufacturers Cups than any other brand.Design HeritageChevrolet cars are some of the best known icons of American culture. The soaring fins of the 1957 Chevy Bel Air epitomized the Jet Age, the sleek 1963 Corvette Stingray was rated as one of the best-looking cars ever by automotive historians and the Camaro, introduced in 1967, brought great design and affordable performance, to younger customers.Chevrolet design innovations helped drive changes and establish new markets in the truck segment. The Suburban, introduced in 1935, is the longest-running automotive nameplate in history. Its concept of delivering greater passenger and cargo capacity has remained true for 76 years.In 1955, the special-edition Chevrolet Cameo Carrier introduced smooth rear fenders for the first time in a mainstream pickup. The styling gave the truck a flowing, upscale appearance, distinctly apart from the traditional ‰ÛÏstep side‰Ûù design of other contemporary trucks. Soon smooth cargo bed sides, which became known as ‰ÛÏfleetside‰Ûù styling, were found on every truck on the market.The Early YearsWilliam C. ‰ÛÏBilly‰Ûù Durant (1861-1947) was a visionary automotive marketer, who founded General Motors in 1908. Swiss-born Louis Chevrolet (1878-1941) was a mechanic, pioneering engineer and a racer ‰ÛÒ he established a land-speed record in 1905, attaining 111 mph in special open race car ‰ÛÒ and was hired by Durant for high-profile races and promotional drives.In 1910, Durant was forced from the company he founded, but he regrouped with other partners to develop a new car. Durant believed Louis Chevrolet‰Ûªs reputation as a racer would help sell the car, so it was named after him. Chevrolet was founded in 1911 and its first car, the Series C Classic Six, was a large, finely crafted motorcar. Its large, 4.9L (299 cubic inches) six-cylinder engine produced 40 horsepower and enabled a top speed of about 65 mph. It sold for $2,150 or the equivalent of nearly $50,000 today, when adjusted for inflation.Despite its high price, the Chevrolet was well regarded for its style, precision and comfort. Durant was also producing a smaller, more affordable car called the Little. Sales of both were strong, but Durant recognized the strength of the entry-level field and steered his company in that direction. The Chevrolet Series C and the Little were produced through 1913. In 1914, the basic Little platform was remade as the Chevrolet Model L and later that year, the Model H was introduced.The refocused Chevrolet line was immediately successful, thanks to a value-driven price and a tough four-cylinder engine. Despite the company‰Ûªs early success, Durant and Chevrolet differed on the philosophy of the company‰Ûªs products. The gulf between them resulted in Durant buying out Chevrolet‰Ûªs interest in the company in 1915. Customers ultimately validated Durant‰Ûªs vision and Chevrolet sales continued to grow. The success enabled Durant to buy a controlling interest in General Motors in 1916. By 1917, Durant was back at the helm of GM with Chevrolet as a division.Durant left General Motors in 1920 to establish another car company, and also becoming a prominent Wall Street investor. The stock market crash of 1929 however proved fatal for both endeavors and he was bankrupt by 1936. He died in 1947 and is buried at the Woodlawn Cemetery in Bronx, New York.Louis Chevrolet also lost his fortune during the Great Depression. He returned to his vocational skills and worked as a mechanic at a Chevrolet factory in Detroit. He died in 1941 and is buried in Indianapolis, near the famous speedway where he forged his reputation as a fearless racer and innovator.Into the next centuryThe electrically driven Volt leads Chevrolet into its second century. It is the world‰Ûªs first mass-produced electric vehicle with gasoline-powered extended range of 379 miles. The Volt provides all the benefits of an electric vehicle without the range limitations‰ÛÓ expanding the boundaries of performance and efficiency. It is redefining what a car means and exemplifies Chevrolet‰Ûªs heritage of introducing advanced technology on value-driven products.The forward-looking philosophy that nurtured Volt from concept to production is also responsible for products such as the Equinox and Cruze. Similarly, the Camaro and Corvette continue a six-decade heritage of offering high-performance value, affordable sports cars. On the truck side, Silverado delivers the greatest capability and better efficiency in the long history of Chevy trucks.Cruze, Volt and Spark are products of Chevrolet‰Ûªs growing global presence. Shared development procedures with engineering and design centers around the globe also help deliver safe and efficient vehicles. The Cruze, for instance, offers 10 standard air bags and the Cruze Eco model offers an EPA-estimated mileage rating of 42 MPG on the highway.Chevrolet enters its second century with great momentum. The next 100 years will see Chevrolet developing automobiles to complement the needs of evolving societies and changing resources ‰ÛÓ all with its iconic style, performance and value."

ciel,http://www.ciel.org/,"Since 1989, the Center for International Environmental Law (CIEL) has used the power of law to protect the environment, promote human rights, and ensure a just and sustainable society. CIEL seeks a world where the law reflects the interconnection between humans and the environment, respects the limits of the planet, protects the dignity and equality of each person, and encourages all of earth's inhabitants to live in balance with each other.    CIEL pursues its mission through legal research and advocacy, education and training, with a focus on connecting global challenges to the experiences of communities on the ground. In the process, we build and maintain lasting partnerships with communities and non-profit organizations around the world.    CIEL uses four cross-cutting legal levers for systemic change to have the greatest impact in supporting our mission and the work of partners around the world: Strengthening international law and systems to protect the environment and human rights; Empowering communities to use international law to defend their rights. Developing and advocating new strategies and global standards for international financial flows, Strengthening the legal tools to counterbalance corporate power and increase transboundary corporate accountability.partnerships with communities and non-profit organizations around the world.    Through using, strengthening, and continually testing these approaches across many aspects of their programs, their goal is to create new legal tools whose potential far exceeds our own capacity to use them. In so doing, CIEL seeks to empower communities and NGOs far beyond those with whom we work directly and, in empowering the broader movement, enable change at a grander scale.    To have the greatest impact, they focus our efforts in four key areas: protecting children and families from toxic risks; accelerating the transition from fossil fuels; slowing the expansion of minerals mining and other extractive industries; and safeguarding forest peoples and biodiversity.","CIEL focuses its work around three program areas:‰Û¢Climate & Energy (C&E)‰Û¢Environmental Health (EH)‰Û¢People, Land, & Resources (PLR)    Climate & Energy Program (C&E) The goal of CIEL‰Ûªs Climate & Energy Program is to develop and use a body of international law to effectively address the threat of climate change while promoting a just and sustainable society. To achieve this goal, we work to hold state and corporate actors responsible for their contributions‰ÛÓboth actions and inactions‰ÛÓto climate change; address harms already occurring as a result of climate change; push governments and key financial institutions to take urgent action to mitigate climate change and transition to clean energy sources; build capacity of and provide direct support to affected communities to defend their rights in strategic cases; and work to ensure that measures to address climate change do not harm but rather benefit people and the environment.    Environmental Health Program (EH) The Environmental Health program is deeply engaged in the fight to improve the regulation of toxic chemicals around the world and to prevent actions that will undermine the progress that has been made. The program combines over twenty years of experience working to reform US, EU and global laws for chemical management with recognized expertise in the area of international trade law to protect our right ‰ÛÒ and the right of future generations ‰ÛÒ to a healthy planet. To achieve this, we seek to create a stronger legal regime to limit toxic exposure by leveraging progress in one region to accelerate change globally. We have worked with EU partners to push the EU towards bold action on emerging areas of concern, namely endocrine disruptors and nanomaterials. We also work with NGO partners and coalitions in the global south to prevent the leakage of pollution to vulnerable communities with limited resources, and to support communities affected by toxic exposure from industrial processes, like metal mining.    People, Land, & Resources Program (PLR) The People, Land & Resources Program (PLR) seeks to protect and defend the environment and human rights against the adverse impacts of development. We work at all levels ‰ÛÒ from international to grassroots ‰ÛÒ to ensure that the laws and policies governing development activities are consistent with those protecting the environment and human rights; and to hold governments and corporations accountable for their actions.

Bloomingdale's stores in Dubai and Kuwait are operated by Al Tayer Group LLC under license agreements. Macy's, Inc. has corporate offices in Cincinnati, Ohio, and New York, New York.","No one would have guessed that the small, fancy dry goods store that opened on the corner of 14th Street and 6th Avenue in New York City in 1858 would grow to be one of the largest retailers in the world.But after several failed retail ventures, Rowland Hussey Macy‰Ûªs determination and ingenuity paid off at the age of 36 with the launch of R.H. Macy & Co. He adopted a red star as his symbol of success, dating back to his days as a sailor. First-day sales totaled $11.06 but by the end of the first full year, sales grossed approximately $85,000. By 1877, R.H. Macy & Co. had become a full-fledged department store occupying the ground space of 11 adjacent buildings.Always the innovator, Macy‰Ûªs is known for several firsts that changed the retail industry. Macy‰Ûªs was the first retailer to promote a woman, Margaret Getchell, to an executive position, making business history. Macy‰Ûªs pioneered such revolutionary business practices as the one-price system, in which the same item was sold to every customer at one price, and quoting specific prices for goods in newspaper advertising. Known for its creative merchandising, Macy‰Ûªs was the first to introduce such products as the Idaho baked potato and colored bath towels. Macy‰Ûªs also was the first retailer to hold a New York City liquor license.By November 1902, the store had outgrown its modest storefront and moved uptown to its present Herald Square location on Broadway and 34th Street, establishing an attraction for shoppers from around the world. With the store‰Ûªs 7th Avenue expansion completed in 1924, Macy‰Ûªs Herald Square became the ‰ÛÏWorld‰Ûªs Largest Store,‰Ûù with more than 1 million square feet of retail space. Note that Macy‰Ûªs Herald Square expanded to 1.1 million square feet of retail space in the renovation project unveiled in 2015.By 1918, R.H. Macy & Co. was generating $36 million in annual sales. Yet, the prosperity of the retailer was never more apparent than when the company went public in 1922 and began to open regional stores and take over competing retailers. In 1923, the Toledo-based department store Lasalle & Koch was acquired; the next year, Davison-Paxton in Atlanta was acquired; and in 1936, the Newark-based Bamberger‰Ûªs was purchased.To help celebrate their new American heritage, Macy‰Ûªs immigrant employees organized the first Christmas Parade in 1924. The procession featured floats, bands, animals from the zoo and 10,000 onlookers, beginning a time-honored tradition now known as the annual Macy‰Ûªs Thanksgiving Day Parade.In 1945, the company expanded west and purchased O‰ÛªConnor Moffatt & Company in San Francisco. Two years later, O‰ÛªConnor Moffatt stores, including the landmark Union Square store that opened in 1866, were converted to Macy‰Ûªs after a survey indicated that San Franciscans would welcome the name.Macy‰Ûªs California broke new ground with the first department store flower show in 1946. What began as a fragrance promotion in the cosmetics department now annually welcomes the spring season, treating visitors to a botanical, cultural and community spectacle and is held in New York City, Chicago, Minneapolis, Philadelphia and Washington, D.C., in addition to San Francisco. In 1971, Macy‰Ûªs Union Square store‰Ûªs lower level, once cluttered with bargains, was transformed into ‰ÛÏThe Cellar,‰Ûù changing the way customers shop for housewares. Due to its success, the Herald Square store followed suit five years later.On December 19, 1994, Federated Department Stores, Inc. (now known as Macy‰Ûªs, Inc.) acquired R.H. Macy & Co., creating the world‰Ûªs largest premier department store company. Federated Department Stores operated more than 400 department stores and 157 specialty stores in 37 states.A&S Department Stores were converted to the Macy‰Ûªs nameplate in May 1995. Also in 1995, Federated acquired The Broadway Department Stores, bringing Broadway, Emporium and Weinstocks to the Macy‰Ûªs family, as well as six former I. Magnin stores. Some 46 stores were converted to the Macy‰Ûªs nameplate. Following the model of A&S, Jordan Marsh Department Stores of Boston, already owned by Federated, was converted to Macy‰Ûªs in March 1996. In January 2001, Macy‰Ûªs absorbed 17 Stern‰Ûªs Department Stores located in New York and New Jersey. In June 2001, Federated purchased the Liberty House operations in Hawaii and Guam, bringing the proud Macy‰Ûªs tradition and heritage to the Pacific.Macy‰Ûªs entered 2005 with about 240 locations, primarily on the East and West Coasts. With the conversion of all Federated‰Ûªs regional store name-plates in March 2005, Macy‰Ûªs grew to about 425 locations across the country. In September 2006, with the conversion of stores acquired from The May Department Stores Company, Macy‰Ûªs served customers through approximately 730 stores. As of April 1, 2017, Macy's now serves customers through approximately 670 stores in virtually every major geographic market in the United States, as well as the macys.com website."

Caltech showed ""how;"" the bank showed ""why."" The ideas came together in the winter and spring of 1979. Founders worked ""out of the box"" to design a revolutionary database management system for parallel processing with multiple microprocessors, specifically for decision support. The microprocessors, like horses, were harnessed to pull a large load rather than relying on one horse to do all the work.1979	Teradata was incorporated on July 13, 1979, and started in a garage in Brentwood, Calif. The name Teradata symbolized the ability to manage terabytes (trillions of bytes) of data. The founders spent the next year raising financing. A seed round of $150,000 closed in March 1980, which allowed design and patent work to begin in earnest.1980	The first VC round, for $2.5 million, closed in July 1980, which let the company hire the R&D team.1983	The first beta system was shipped to Wells Fargo Bank just in time for Christmas.1986	Fortune magazine named Teradata ""Product of the Year.""

mini,http://www.miniusa.com/content/miniusa/en.html,"Almost without fail, people unfamiliar with us are shocked at how spacious the inside of a MINI really is. But we've been performing this magic trick for over 50 years. Because innovations we introduced in 1959 for the Classic Mini, such as turning the engine sideways and our famous wheels-at-the-corners layout, were actually invented for the sole purpose of creating as much passenger room as possible.    Of course, another way to create more space is to ignore the naysayers and grammar police and simply build a bigger MINI. Or two. Which is exactly what we did with the MINI Countryman and the MINI Clubman.","To put it simply, driving a MINI isn't like driving other cars. It's why there are thousands of testaments online to its world-famous, razor-sharp handling. Some people equate the incredibly responsive ride to a roller coaster; others, a go-kart.

As an employer, neighbor and steward of the planet's natural resources, we believe that every employee and organizational partner has the power to positively impact the world around us.","The History of The HartfordFor more than 200 years, The Hartford has helped people prepare for the unexpected, protect what is important to them and prevail through life‰Ûªs challenges and opportunities. Our success comes from our commitment to doing the right thing, while adapting and reinventing to remain relevant and indispensable to our customers.Throughout our history, countless businesses, institutions and individuals have turned to our company for protection.Our First CenturyIn 1810, we started as a fire insurance company, employing our own fire department to protect customers. Fifteen years later, we wrote the first insurance policy for an institution of higher learning ‰ÛÒ Yale University.In 1835, we proved ourselves different from other insurance companies. After a fire destroyed New York‰Ûªs financial district, people learned that insurance companies were walking away from their claims. Eliphalet Terry, then president of The Hartford Fire Insurance Company, called a meeting of the directors when news of the fire reached Hartford; they pledged their personal fortunes to help pay the claims. This bolstered the people and businesses of New York, allowing the rebuilding process to begin. It also served to bolster the economy of a growing nation by showing business people, leaders and citizens in all States that there was an insurance company able to protect their property and stand-by claims, no matter how large they grew or the size of the disaster. Confidence in The Hartford and with insurance grew. In 1861, President Abraham Lincoln purchased a fire insurance policy to protect his home and property he was leaving in Illinois while serving in Washington, D.C. In fact, he wasn‰Ûªt the only political figure of the time that trusted The Hartford to protect what was important. Robert E. Lee, commander of the Confederate Army during the Civil War, purchased a home insurance policy from The Hartford for his property in Virginia, now a part of Arlington National Cemetery.We continued to bolster a growing American economy by covering claims and aiding in recovery after massive catastrophes. In 1871, The Hartford paid all of its claims after a fire ripped through more than 3 square miles of Chicago businesses and homes. In 1906, almost 500 city blocks in San Francisco were destroyed as an earthquake toppled the city and fires burned for several days. The Hartford responded by paying over $11 million in damage claims ‰ÛÒ the largest of any insurance company involved in the disaster. With each of these disasters, the people of the United States saw that there was an insurance company that would help cover their losses and rebuild, no matter how large the company or the disaster. As the United States moved into the 20th century, the technology that businesses and the American people used evolved rapidly ‰ÛÒ especially evident with the automobile. The Hartford saw the need to provide protection that went beyond fire coverage. Wanting to ensure that people could protect their automobiles and other property from more than just fire damage, The Hartford formed its Accident and Indemnity Company in 1913. This 2nd company provided a wide variety of insurance coverage, including accident, automobile liability, personal damage and business interruption. This new generation of insurance protection enabled growth of many industries, including automobiles.Our Second Century and ForwardThe Hartford has continued to help our customers persevere, providing insurance to businesses and well-known people including Babe Ruth and President Dwight D. Eisenhower. We have encouraged businesses to strive to create structures and buildings on a scale the world had never seen by guaranteeing coverage. We insured some of the largest construction projects ever, including the Hoover Dam, the St. Lawrence Seaway and the Golden Gate Bridge.As the demands of businesses, families and individuals of the United States evolved, so did we. Wanting to help smaller businesses succeed, we became the first insurance provider to offer a dedicated small business service center in 1983. The following year, we became the only insurance company to provide auto and home insurance to members of AARP ‰ÛÒ an agreement that‰Ûªs still in place today.In 2001, our nation was changed forever as we witnessed the September 11th terror attacks. In response, The Hartford paid over $850 million in claims and made major donations to the United Way and other organizations that were impacted by the tragedy.The Hartford has continued on its path of excellence: Becoming a founding partner of the U.S. Paralympics in 2003Being named one of the world‰Ûªs most ethical companies eight times since 2008Celebrating our 200th Anniversary in 2010 We believe that if you want to know where a business is going, you should look at where it has been. The Hartford looks forward to another 200 years of helping our customers prevail."

Here you‰Ûªll discover key facts on the company and its operations, highlights from recent media coverage and our own press releases. We thank you for visiting us and look forward to creating a brighter future with youWhen compared to coal, prices of clean energy sources have plummeted. Wind prices have halved since 2009, while the cost of solar panels has decreased 80% since 2008. More than 50,000 megawatts of clean energy have been brought online in America since 2010 as the prices of alternative energies have continued to go down and the product has become more accessible. This has offset roughly same amount of coal-fired power that has been shut down across the country as we transition to 100% clean and renewable power. But the U.S. has not yet reached its full potential. Germany receives about the same level of solar irradiance as Alaska, yet it still manages to lead the world in solar capacity. In October 2013, Germany managed to power nearly 60% of the country from solar and wind energy, giving proof that renewable energy can, and will, play a vital role in generating electricity in the future.WHO WE AREMosaic makes it simple to go solar by leveraging technology and financial innovation, with a goal of providing access to clean energy for everyone.

Pulp may be mixed in at this point, too, depending on the product. Our blend team and expert tasters manage the daily quality and regularly sample our juice to ensure consistent great taste.","The Tropicana story begins with Anthony T. Rossi, who arrived in the U.S. with just $25 in his pocket. He founded Tropicana in 1947 with the mission of making the goodness of the finest fruit accessible to everyone. He developed flash pasteurization and pioneered orange juice transport in 1970 via train from Florida to New York. As Tropicana continues to grow, we have Anthony Rossi to thank for creating the spirit of innovation and fresh thinking that continues at Tropicana today.Each year, Tropicana buys more Florida oranges than anybody else, and we‰Ûªre proud to say we‰Ûªre the No. 1 buyer of Florida fruit. While the exact percentage may vary by crop size, Tropicana purchases about a third of all oranges grown in the state.

This relationship helps us fulfill our promise of bringing you juice with straight-from-the-orange taste any time of year.To make the best juice, Tropicana only uses the best groves. They are known for their superior sandy soil conditions, state-of-the-art irrigation practices and commitment to growing the finest citrus in the world. We monitor more than 400 Florida groves through a proprietary system that ensures our oranges are harvested at their peak goodness and flavor. Each of our dedicated and experienced growers is passionate about making sure we pick our oranges at the perfect time. Once the fruit is picked, it is quickly delivered to Tropicana‰Ûªs juice-making plants. The fresh oranges are hand-graded and any fruit that doesn‰Ûªt meet our stringent standards is removed. Then the oranges are washed and the orange oil is extracted from the peel to capture the from-the-orange taste and aromas that are later carefully blended into the juice for consistent quality and flavor. The oranges are then gently squeezed ‰ÛÒ to protect the juice and provide that unique, straight-from-the-orange Tropicana taste. Next, the fresh juice is flash pasteurized ‰ÛÒ a process developed by Tropicana to minimize the time the orange juice is exposed to heat while providing maximum nutrition and flavor. Pasteurization makes products such as juice and milk safe to drink. Oranges have a limited growing season, and because consumers want our great-tasting juice all year round, some juice is then stored for future packaging in chilled tanks to preserve quality. These tanks protect the juice from oxygen and light and hold the liquid at optimal temperatures just above freezing to maintain the best nutrition and taste possible."

From those humble beginnings, Tyson Foods has grown over the years and decades to find new ways to help feed the nation, with the belief that every family deserves to bring quality chicken to their table. As we've grown, our beliefs remain the same. Be good. Be humble. And always keep it real.","Quality Is What We‰Ûªll Always DeliverWhen John W. Tyson was still driving his old truck across the country, folks kept coming back for the chicken he brought because he always delivered on his promise of quality. Plain and simple.

From our hatcheries, to the farms we work with, to our careful inspection of all of our chicken, we‰Ûªre committed to making sure you get farm-raised chicken of the highest quality to serve up to your family."

EOG's strategy is to generate the best rates of return by controlling operating and capital costs while maximizing oil and natural gas reserve recoveries. EOG strives to maintain the lowest possible operating cost structure that is consistent with prudent and safe operations.

This important domestic energy source is also used to produce steel, glass, paper, clothing, brick and electricity, and is an essential raw material for many common products such as fertilizer. The increased use of natural gas is also important in addressing climate change concerns because of its clean, low-carbon content.

It's our agents and employees who follow the Golden Rule  _ treating others as you would want to be treated.","The two founders ‰ÛÒ H.O. Hirt and O.G. Crawford ‰ÛÒ had a plan, which they wrote on a 10-cent tablet (today‰Ûªs equivalent of a business prospectus), but they needed money. It took 3 months and 20 days ‰ÛÒ about the length of one Erie winter ‰ÛÒ to raise the $31,000 they needed, winning over 90 stockholders with their hand-written business plan, their tenacity and their true belief in what they were about to do. On April 20, 1925, the Erie Insurance Exchange was born ‰ÛÒ one of the first policies written was on H.O.‰Ûªs own Dodge touring car. The company‰Ûªs mantra became ‰ÛÏThe ERIE is Above all in SERvIcE,‰Ûù with the ‰ÛÏerie‰Ûù raised in the word service. That still serves as the company‰Ûªs tagline today.Evidence of this service was that customers were encouraged to call collect. And if a policyholder had a problem with a claim, he or she could make a phone call directly to H.O. Hirt.After only three years, ERIE was already expanding. A second office was opened in Pittsburgh in 1928. The company took its first steps outside of Pennsylvania in 1953 when it opened a branch in Silver Spring, Maryland.At the same time ERIE was expanding its territories, it also expanded its product offerings. In 1934, ERIE introduced the ‰ÛÏSuper Standard Auto Policy.‰Ûù It included many features that have since become industry standards. Fire insurance was added in 1940, and inland marine in 1954."

Now, over a decade later, we still deliver on that idea every day. With a customer list ranging from medium-sized businesses to Fortune 50 enterprises, 70 percent of which are live, Workday achieved an industry-leading 97 percent customer satisfaction rating this year.Workday has many large companies across its customer base. How long has it served the medium enterprise market?We‰Ûªve always served this market. In fact, a substantial portion of our existing customers are medium enterprises. Workday‰Ûªs true cloud model delivers the same levels of service and the same positive business outcomes to all of our customers, whether they have several hundred local employees, or hundreds of thousands of workers across the globe.Why do medium enterprises choose Workday?There is often a combination of factors that prompt medium enterprises to make a change. They‰Ûªre likely looking for a proven enterprise system to support them in their growth, be it organic, through merger and acquisition, or preparing for a public offering of stock. They may be struggling with a large number of obsolete applications, and want to move to a single system in the cloud for finance, HR, and payroll that offers insights into their business and improves operational efficiency. They may be seeking more flexibility and speed as they respond to change, such as new regulations. One example of that is ASC 606, the new revenue recognition standard that comes into effect next year.‰ÛÏLegacy systems were designed to report the past. Workday was designed to report the past, monitor and control the present, and best prepare for the future.‰ÛùWhat differentiates Workday from its competitors?We believe we offer medium enterprises an exceptional alternative to our competitors in three key elements of success: capabilities, value, and ownership. Let‰Ûªs take a look:Capabilities: Workday executes transactions, but we go beyond that‰ÛÓwe capture information at the point of action, with business processes built in. Our competitors‰Ûª legacy systems were designed for data entry after the fact, following a manual workflow. Workday‰Ûªs object technology allows for the representation of real-world entities such as workers, benefits, budgets, and organizations without the technical complexity and rigidity associated with legacy vendors‰Ûª relational database architectures. This allows Workday to capture both the content and context of everyday business events and deliver financial, operational, and management reporting from the same set of data in real time. Legacy systems were designed to report the past. Workday was designed to report the past, monitor and control the present, and best prepare for the future.Value: We put tremendous focus on creating a consumer-like experience and developing for mobile devices. But it goes beyond that. Legacy systems were designed for ‰ÛÏback office‰Ûù administrators. Workday was designed to provide value at the front lines of business, while automatically handling administrative and compliance requirements. Every employee in an organization can use Workday because it is easy to use and a valuable productivity tool.Ownership: We believe our service levels are superior to the competition, and all customers, no matter their size, enjoy the same level of service. Our approach is clearly working, because our customers have once again given us a 97 percent customer satisfaction rating. All of our customers become part of an exceptional community‰ÛÓfor example, they participate in Workday Community, a private online community where customers, partners, and Workday employees collaborate and share best practices. They also enjoy our continuous development approach, with the opportunity to choose new features and functionality as they become available. Customers benefit from an agile and scalable technology foundation that helps them rapidly adjust to changing requirements and business growth, without the need for an army of outside consultants or added resources. And finally, our medium enterprise customers are able to deploy quickly, with built-in control processes and always-on auditing to help proactively protect them against risk and fraud.How does Workday approach deployment for medium enterprises?We often talk about the Workday Power of One, and deployment is another area where it shines. Since every customer is on the same codeline, we are able to leverage deployment artifacts (things like security models, business processes, and reports) from previous customer deployments. These artifacts have been curated from hundreds of medium enterprise customers, and are leveraged for new customers. Every new engagement starts with a relevant preconfigured tenant, which lowers risk and costs as the customer sees its people, plans, and reporting structures at the beginning of the project. Workday Launch takes the approach to the next level by providing preconfigured packages for a fixed fee and time-to-production of four to six months.Can you give some examples of medium enterprise customers and what success looks like for them?Companies such as Bill Gosling Outsourcing, CustomInk, Ensono, and Patagonia, as mentioned in today‰Ûªs news release, have chosen Workday to streamline processes, increase productivity, and reduce risk across their finance, HR, and payroll operations. With Workday, medium enterprises receive predictable timelines and flexible technology to meet their current objectives, drive business growth, and adapt to change as market conditions evolve.We have great traction in this space, with many live and happy medium enterprise customers who are seeing measurable results. But we‰Ûªre just getting started, and I see a huge opportunity ahead."
